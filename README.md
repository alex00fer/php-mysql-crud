This was a class project where we had to create an API in PHP for CRUD functionality (Create, read, update and delete) from a MySQL table.
Then this API is accesed from javascript using AJAX. The website offers an intuitive way to make this actions thanks to its autocompletition and auto-variable fields. Also the page is responsive!
